#### [We treat toolmakers like tools](https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-tooling/#we-treat-toolmakers-like-tools)

Great article from [@swyx](https://www.swyx.io/). I especially appreciated the linked section. So often I see individuals from my local dev community disparage open source maintainers and their contributions, and basically treating them like dirt. And on Github, developers making demands for sweeping changes without offering to lift a finger to help, and blasting the maintainer publicly when they do not immediately capitulate. It's pretty disgusting.

Yeah, large companies who profit immensely from open source can (and should) do more to sustain these projects, but individuals can go a long way as well by not treating these maintainers like worms.

#### Tree-sitter in Neovim

Pretty exciting news: [this long running patch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/10124) to add [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) support to Neovim just got approved and looks like it’ll be merged soon.

Tree-sitter is an AST parser / generator from Github that’s crazy fast, and can be used for tasks traditionally done “crudely” with regex, like syntax highlighting and code folding.

One interesting side effect for theming is that this should cause syntax highlighting to look remarkably similar across different languages, since theoretically you just need to theme the various AST nodes once.
