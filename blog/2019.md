#### Tree-sitter in Neovim

Pretty exciting news: [this long running patch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/10124) to add [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) support to Neovim just got approved and looks like it’ll be merged soon.

Tree-sitter is an AST parser / generator from Github that’s crazy fast, and can be used for tasks traditionally done “crudely” with regex, like syntax highlighting and code folding.

One interesting side effect for theming is that this should cause syntax highlighting to look remarkably similar across different languages, since theoretically you just need to theme the various AST nodes once.
