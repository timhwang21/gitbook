#### Is Redux dead?

AKA one of the most common blog titles in the React ecosystem seemingly every year.

It seems like most of the tools and patterns people point to as evidence of Redux's death merely replace one aspect of Redux, and arguably the most conceptually simple part: the problem of having a shared data store.

[Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-javascript) points out in the section *Thinking In Events, Not Setters* that this is missing the entire picture. Redux is not simply a reactive getter/setter. **It's a way of encapsulating changes to application state as events**. It's a way of handling state in an event-driven way, in a domain (web applications) that are fundamentally event-driven.

> ”I don't know anything, but I do know that everything is interesting if you go into it deeply enough.”

This quote really encapsulates my thinking whenever I'm asked in interviews why I want to join a company. To me, industry and product don't really matter that much. As long as there are smart people, any space will have interesting engineering problems once you go deep enough.

#### [We treat toolmakers like tools](https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-tooling/#we-treat-toolmakers-like-tools)

Great article from [@swyx](https://www.swyx.io/). I especially appreciated the linked section. So often I see individuals from my local dev community disparage open source maintainers and their contributions, and basically treating them like dirt. And on Github, developers making demands for sweeping changes without offering to lift a finger to help, and blasting the maintainer publicly when they do not immediately capitulate. It's pretty disgusting.

Yeah, large companies who profit immensely from open source can (and should) do more to sustain these projects, but individuals can go a long way as well by not treating these maintainers like worms.

#### Tree-sitter in Neovim

Pretty exciting news: [this long running patch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/10124) to add [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) support to Neovim just got approved and looks like it’ll be merged soon.

Tree-sitter is an AST parser / generator from Github that’s crazy fast, and can be used for tasks traditionally done “crudely” with regex, like syntax highlighting and code folding.

One interesting side effect for theming is that this should cause syntax highlighting to look remarkably similar across different languages, since theoretically you just need to theme the various AST nodes once.
