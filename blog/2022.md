#### [Why There Is No Good NFT Art (Yet?)](https://caesuramag.org/posts/laurie-rojas-why-no-good-nft-yet)

> NFTs have not only opened the door wide open for the crypto bros’s capital to finally have something to buy, speculate, and fight over; they have shown that no matter how “decentralized” or “transparent” the whole blockchain infrastructure (or “protocol”) is, it is still a capitalist jungle, though with the delusion that the jungle is a playground. What happened with Beeple’s record-breaking sale at auction, which was bought by two crypto billionaires to inflate the value of crypto, is no different than what collectors do to inflate the price of their Andy Warhols by up-bidding new lots on the auction floor, which is illegal but nonetheless still happens. But no one in their right mind would ever say Beeble’s works are good Art, while we can argue differently with Warhol, Koons, and Hirst.

> NFTs (art, Deviant, memes, and otherwise) will end up in the same place as everything else on the internet, which is the same place as everything else in late capitalism: controlled by a few mega corporations, which the government (the state) will assist in their exploitation, surveillance, and censorship of the small/individual players. Just as the Democrats ruined social media. Signs of clashes already abound from sports stars/channels producing collectible “celebrity NFTs” that feed upon the “little guy” making Deviant/burner art NFTs, while Hermès is suing an artist for its MetaBirkins NFT on grounds of trademark infringement.

I was watching some old runway shows after catching up with the latest of PFW 2022. [Anrealage 18AW 'Prism'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNmXyyN5KQc) inspired this CSS micro-interaction. Specifically, [the logo](https://i.imgur.com/IrF2m9K.png).

[**How “Engineering-Driven” Leads to “Engineering-Supremacy”**](https://charity.wtf/2022/01/20/how-engineering-driven-leads-to-engineering-supremacy/)

Resonated with me not only because I find the points spot on, but also because the culture Charity describes at Honeycomb fits my own personal ideal of a model culture to strive for, and seems like a more mature form of the culture we're trying to foster at Persona. Even the timeline of Honeycomb's evolution as an organization tracks with us.

[**An Anatomy of Bitcoin Price Manipulation**](https://www.singlelunch.com/2022/01/09/an-anatomy-of-bitcoin-price-manipulation/)

This is a fun one for sure. I've believed the conclusions described here for a long time, but admittedly that belief was based on my personal view of what was likely given the landscape (media-driven price + presence of large "whales" + lack of regulation) rather than hard evidence.

[**On -Cores**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13-qLZzgENG8Rbacf68agh0XC7a1YVgHInGJ2oMQsbFY/)

Long treatise on aesthetics. I find the writing style an interesting blend of fairly unrefined prose, deep technical knowledge (of film, cinematography, art history, culture, and philosophy), and references to modern-day memes. Undecided if it's an idiosyncratic writing style or an intentional "high-low" mixing to match the subject matter (a "high-level" analysis of the "low-level" phenomenon of youth/internet culture) .
