I was watching some old runway shows after catching up with the latest of PFW 2022. [Anrealage 18AW 'Prism'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNmXyyN5KQc) inspired this CSS micro-interaction. Specifically, [the logo](https://i.imgur.com/IrF2m9K.png).

[**How “Engineering-Driven” Leads to “Engineering-Supremacy”**](https://charity.wtf/2022/01/20/how-engineering-driven-leads-to-engineering-supremacy/)

Resonated with me not only because I find the points spot on, but also because the culture Charity describes at Honeycomb fits my own personal ideal of a model culture to strive for, and seems like a more mature form of the culture we're trying to foster at Persona. Even the timeline of Honeycomb's evolution as an organization tracks with us.

This is a fun one for sure. I've believed the conclusions described here for a long time, but admittedly that belief was based on my personal view of what was likely given the landscape (media-driven price + presence of large "whales" + lack of regulation) rather than hard evidence.

Long treatise on aesthetics. I find the writing style an interesting blend of fairly unrefined prose, deep technical knowledge (of film, cinematography, art history, culture, and philosophy), and references to modern-day memes. Undecided if it's an idiosyncratic writing style or an intentional "high-low" mixing to match the subject matter (a "high-level" analysis of the "low-level" phenomenon of youth/internet culture) .
