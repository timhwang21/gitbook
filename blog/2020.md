#### [OSX: Have Finder open files in vim](https://thepugautomatic.com/2015/02/open-in-iterm-vim-from-finder/)

Slightly modified and added to my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/timhwang21/dotfiles/commit/e221fd7df5d78b38acd7fd0aa12d4ed5e8713300), though it's not really a dotfile. TODO: Find a better solution for including self-written scripts and applications for new machine setup.

Source: (Applescript really is the ugliest language ever.)

```applescript
on run {input, parameters}
	set filename to POSIX path of input
	set cmd to "clear;cd `dirname " & filename & "`;vim " & filename
	tell application "iTerm"
		tell the current window
			create tab with default profile
			tell the current session
				write text cmd
			end tell
		end tell
	end tell
end run
```

#### Bolster tests while refactoring

I ran into an idea that's novel to me today, that is apparently common in the Haskell community. When refactoring, the old implementation is kept around in its entirety, and then acts as a test model for the new implementation for as long as is necessary. This is _slightly_ more robust than just keeping around some list of fixtures for specs.

This is partially enabled by the Haskell test ecosystem having good DX around autogenerating primitive fixtures and running a barrage of them against your code, but that's a tractable problem in other languages.

#### Stripe's ecosystem

As a user, Stripe's accounts ecosystem is a thing of beauty. Pay for something with Stripe once, and if you visit the checkout page of another vendor using Stripe, you are automatically contacted with a verification code that imports your payment details automatically. Shopify's system is somewhat similar but Stripe's implementation is so low friction it actually brought a tear to my eye. Will definitely be drawing inspiration from here for work.

#### [Chain of Command](https://github.com/timhwang21/chain-of-command)

After months of procrastination, I've finally gotten this to a feature-complete v1 stage. It's a fairly simple Haskell program that analyzes your shell history to help you identify areas you can optimize with aliases.
