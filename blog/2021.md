#### Draft blog post: balancing confidence and competence


**Mind the confidence-competence gap - Balancing self-confidence and self-doubt**

Previously I wrote about [continuing to grow by developing an eye for quality](https://medium.com/better-programming/youve-settled-in-as-an-engineer-now-what-b7f12c277131). Today, I want to focus on ensuring continued growth by minding the *confidence-competence gap*.

Self-confidence is a tricky thing to manage. Too much confidence leads to blind arrogance: arrogant individuals are overconfident in their eye for quality and automatically discount conflicting information as incorrect. On the flip side, too little confidence leads to anxiety and impostor syndrome: anxious individuals question their ability to perform in the face of uncertanty, and thus avoid leaving their comfort zones. In both cases, the stream of information feeding one’s model of quality slows to a trickle, leading to a stagnation of ideas. With this, one’s model of quality starts to rot, and growth of competence comes to a standstill.

The “right level” of confidence is relative to one’s competence. Overconfidence alone doesn’t necessarily lead to negative outcomes if that confidence is backed by a similarly high level of competence; similarly, lack of confidence in beginners can act as a motivator to pursue higher levels of competence. The Thus, *managing the confidence-competence gap* is essential for maintaining a healthy and consistent rate of personal growth.

*[What’s the purpose of this article? Supporting evidence mainly pushes argument towards “you should aim for the optimal quadrant” but doesn’t really say how.]*

**Confidence vs. competence**

*[Better intro. This is too handwavey. It’s just a random oversimplified mental model I came up with.]*

Theoretically, there is some optimal range we should aim to keep confidence within relative to our level of competence.

There isn’t a clear way to derive this range. Confidence and competence are both latent variables that psychologists have been trying to measure for decades (and the effect sizes aren’t particularly convincing). Rather than attempting to map out a precise relationship, I find it more useful to think about what the various cases of confidence-competence mismatch look like. By exploring each in turn, we can identify attributes of confidence-competence mismatch to avoid, as well as attributes of confidence-competence alignment to pursue.

*[Maybe cut this paragraph.]* In my head, I subdivide this chart of competence vs. confidence into four quadrants: *beginner*, *impostor syndrome*, *optimal*, and what I will simply call *“fucked”*. *[TODO: better word for “optimal”. Maybe embrace silliness and go with “unicorn”, or more serious with “10x”. The article’s already fairly tongue-in-cheek anyways.]*

Alternate diagrams: someone is definitely gonna bring up Dunning-Kruger. This is IMO a more realistic representation of it, at least in engineering. Not meant to be a continuum; instead shows “standard” paths of growth.

State machine representation:

Beginner

* => impostor syndrome — standard transition

* => optimal — unlikely; means you’re insanely inherently talented

* => fucked — unlikely; usually quickly smacked in face by reality so back to beginner

Impostor syndrome

* => beginner — not allowed; competence doesn’t regress

* => optimal — ideal transition

* => fucked — unlikely but possible (maybe when you read too many self-help books)

Optimal

* => beginner — not allowed

* => impostor syndrome — it happens

* => fucked — when you start buying into your own BS too much

Fucked

* => beginner — not allowed

* => impostor syndrome — probably the best path to recovery / recdivism

* => optimal — you beat the odds?

**Beginners: Low confidence, low competence**

Beginners are blank slates. Everyone more or less begins at this level, and the experience can be summed up as:
> “Okay I’ve conned these rubes into hiring me and I need to work 14 hours a day or they’ll find out I’m a fraud and how does my coworker who’s two years older than me know everything under the sun and what the hell is this [insane flowchart of skills](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) I’m supposed to learn and I really can’t tell if our architect is listing off [technologies or Pokémon](https://pixelastic.github.io/pokemonorbigdata/) and-” — average “beginner” engineer

After several more cycles of *“I have no idea what the hell I am doing”*, there’s eventually a moment of *“wait, I actually do kind of know what I’m doing” *where you realize both your confidence and competence have leveled up just a little bit.

It’s unlikely for beginners to transition to the “fucked” category, as overconfident beginners usually get smacked in the face by reality fairly quickly. The inverse is far more common, in which beginners gain competence over time but do not see a corresponding increase in competence. This marks the beginning of impostor syndrome, a problem that’s all too common in our industry.

**Impostor syndrome: competence exceeds confidence**

Impostor syndrome is prevalent at all levels of competence, and is probably the default quadrant for beginners to transition to. Confidence generally trails confidence, meaning that early career engineers are generally capable of more than they think they are. High performers may be particularly susceptible to impostor syndrome: they constantly push the edge of their comfort zone, which is great for learning but can erode self-confidence over time.

Impostor syndrome limits effectiveness and hurts execution. When no one on a team quite knows how to approach a problem, decision paralysis can bias the team towards endless “information collection and research” due to a collective fear of failure to commit. This can easily kill a product by bringing development to a standstill, when it would have been far more effective to try, fail, learn, and iterate.

More insidiously, impostor syndrome stunts growth by keeping people in their comfort zones. Junior engineers may avoid unfamiliar tasks, limiting themselves to tasks they know they can perform well. Mid-level engineers know that they can effectively execute decisions created by smarter people, but may balk at product or leadership tasks that require a lot of decision making. Senior engineers constantly second guess the decisions they do make, and have trouble committing without constantly seeking confirmation from trusted superiors. Constantly avoiding challenge results in a lack of new information — the prerequisite for growth.

Impostor syndrome can contribute to depression and burnout. Engineers in this quadrant may constantly feel like they are letting their peers down; saddled by guilt, their effectiveness drops even further. A once-loved role may become a constant source of fear and stress.

As time passes and competence continues to outstrip confidence, impostor syndrome may evolve into a form of learned helplessness. Individuals may start to believe that their current role is the best fit out there, and that any more challenging role would be guaranteed to come with an intolerable amount of stress or negative work-life balance. Seeking a better job is viewed as utterly unthinkable. Unethical employers love engineers like this: they are the perfect prey to exploit at below-market salaries, and they won’t even try to run away! Over the years, the engineer has every last drop of juice squeezed out of them, until only a burnt-out, dessicated husk remains.

There isn’t much I can say about avoiding impostor syndrome that others haven’t said already, but it’s a difficult problem for sure. The majority of engineers I know fall within this quadrant, myself included (I hope — I’m definitely not in the “optimal” quadrant, and I *really* hope I’m not in the “fucked” quadrant). I’ve personally found that talking to a trusted mentor is one of the most effective safeguards. Regardless of how it’s done, engineers move to the “optimal” quadrant once they get a handle on their confidence.

*[Cut some exposition and talk more on how to avoid impostor syndrome? But that’s basically an entire article in itself, and that topic has been done to death.]*

**Optimal: high confidence, high competence**

Engineers in this quadrant are almost mythical. The *unicorns*. The *10x engineers*. There are endless labels for these engineers; simply put, they are *effective.* These are the people organizations want leading their important initiatives. Not only are they able to execute well, they are confident in their decision-making capabilities, and are able to forge ahead in the face of uncertainty without fearing failure. Even if they make the wrong decision, they can quickly adapt and iterate using their learnings from their mistakes.

The concept of the “10x engineer” is generally viewed with derision, but I feel the idea is misunderstood. 10x engineers don’t work ten times more hours, or write ten times more lines of code, they produce *ten times the value.* I’ve had the privilege to work with several engineers that fit this qualification, and watching them is truly mind-boggling. From my perspective, this insane productivity comes from two main sources: first, they arrive at a reasonable decision in the face of uncertainty faster than anyone else; and second, they realize when a decision is incorrect faster than anyone else. While regular engineers like me are poring over an endless array of feasible solutions for a problem, these engineers are already coding; and while I am writing patch after patch to retrofit a product with functionality it wasn’t designed for, they are already working on a V2 of the product that has the missing functionality built-in. *[Too long?]*

“Optimal” engineers are well-aware of their limits. They are confident, but not so confident that they are unwilling to entertain new ideas and paradigms. Because they have well developed models of quality, they are able to quickly differentiate quality new ideas from junk. When combined with the speed at which they iterate (and hence encounter even more novel information), they become hyper-optimized growth machines.

Ideally, this quadrant is the end state for engineers. In reality, most “good” engineers I’ve met fluctuate between “impostor syndrome” and “optimal.” It’s certainly better than the alternative: for some engineers, confidence continues to grow unbounded, and they transition to the final quadrant: “fucked.”

**Fucked: confidence exceeds competence**

*[Some intro? “Fucked” because while they may still be competent and productive, their trajectory is on a downward spiral, and it’s hard to escape.]*

“Fucked” engineers put too much stock into their own decisions. They are so confident in their mental models of quality that they begin relying more and more on heuristics. They trust their snap judgments, and don’t see a need to critically engage with new ideas. Because of their rigid models of quality, contrary viewpoints are assumed to be incorrect and are disregarded, removing all impetus for growth. As confidence grows, introspection and self-questioning decrease, to the point that they are unaware (or unwilling to acknowledge) just how far their competence lags behind their confidence.

“Fucked” engineers are exhausting to work with. Due to their reliance on snap judgments, they are unwilling to engage with contrary ideas and viewpoints, aggressively bulldozing the opinions of engineers in the “beginner” and “impostor syndrome” quadrants. Furthermore, they may be unwilling to abandon sinking ships due to their unwavering faith in their decisions, preferring to stay the course rather than pivot and iterate. While they may still be skilled and capable of producing quality work, organizations should aim to ruthlessly purge these individuals.

“Fucked” engineers often consider themselves as having defeated impostor syndrome. When hearing about young programmers struggling with impostor syndrome, they nod sagely and sanctimoniously recount how they too used to be plagued by an inner voice of self-doubt, until they learned to shout it down and block it from their heads. These are the very people who should be paying attention to their inner voice! Self-doubt can be crippling, but it can also be a warning bell that one is going off the deep end of delusional self-confidence. Once this voice has been silenced, future growth is stunted, and it is incredibly difficult to get back on the right path.

“Fucked” engineers are increasingly likely to attribute blame externally as their confidence further exceeds their competence. When encountering problems with some unfamiliar tool, they are increasingly likely to blame the tool over their own lack of understanding. They make a snap judgment about the quality of the tool, complain about “pointless new paradigms,” and wonder why everyone doesn’t just use the old tool they are familiar with. If they are unable to instantly be productive with a new tool, the new tool is garbage.

“Fucked” engineers eventually lose the capability to learn, and ultimately become outdated and irrelevant. They constantly rail about how modern tech is all garbage, and how today’s programmers are idiots. While we generally think of these engineers as “crusty old dinosaurs,” I’ve found that young engineers can be just as “fucked” as older ones — we just remember to the older ones because they reinforce our existing stereotypes. You don’t have to be old to be a dinosaur.

(Again, it’s unlikely but possible to transition from “beginner” to “fucked.” But these engineers are generally brought down to size quickly, and transition back to the “beginner” quadrant.) *[Cut?]*

**Balancing self-confidence and self-doubt**

*[WIP — bring back to central thesis (which is…?)]*

1. As one progresses in their career, their competence naturally grows; the “right” level of confidence should track one’s competence as it grows over time.

1. Learn to self-questioning without fear or blame. Make introspection and second-guessing yourself from as neutral a perspective as possible a habit. Inspiration from blameless port mortems (Google, Pagerduty, Atlassian); similar principles can be applied to self-evaluation. You want to identify what you’re doing wrong and where you can improve, but in a way that doesn’t make you feel bad or like a shit engineer. Doing this also gives you something to talk about during your 1:1s with managers.

1. Try to identify traits of beginner, impostor syndrome, fucked in yourself. Use these as warning signs to reorient.

1. Don’t make it a goal to be a unicorn. An intermediate goal is to simply aim to keep confidence in line with competence. Your competence naturally increases over time as you’re exposed to more stuff. Yet another shill to previous article — focus on exploring confidence in this article. If you’re not confident enough, you don’t commit and iterate a lot slower; this reduces speed of learning. If you’re too confident, you are resistant to new ideas; this also reduces speed of learning. In other words, if you second guess yourself too much without protecting your ego, you’ll have a crisis of confidence, but if you protect your ego too much, you’ll also fail. As long as confidence and competence are linked, over time you will eventually become a unicorn. (Theoretically, at least.)

1. Never stop self questioning. Uber CTO Thuan Pham (2013–2020). Prerequisite of Uber being toxic yada yada, but I really admire this quote:
> Q: What is the one thing you do every day that helps you achieve your goals?
 A: I reflect. I think about the things that happened that day and ask myself, “Is that the best thing I could have done?” The answer almost always is: “I could have done it better.”

This level of self-questioning from the guy who took VMWare from a 300 person company to a 15,00 person behemoth, then turned around and took Uber from 40 engineers to a ~$100 billion market cap. Similar quote from him: “never allow yourself to be comfortable.”

#### Tips for big product launches

- Set **dates first** instead of **features first**. With featuers first, all dates end up being padded. Setting dates first forces you to really scope correctly and identify the MVP, and get to a state where you can start iterating. "Plan for 6 weeks and schedule for 3 weeks; plan to miss but aim to succeed."
- For the MVP, plan out acceptance tests, and adhere to them strictly. Use these as accountability tools for an objective measurement of progress. If an acceptance test is not passing by a deadline, really hone in on it.
- Learning how to correctly handle a big launch is hard. "This is why I don't recommend juniors join startups." At larger companies, you can fail without risking the existence of the company, and you can observe good practices. Because there are more large launches, you can evaluate them against each other for quality.

#### [China containment policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_containment_policy)

I never thought history was interesting. In high school, I treated AP US History as simply another bundle of credits to jumpstart college.

The NYT published [How Neil Sheehan Got the Pentagon Papers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/pentagon-papers-neil-sheehan.html) today, and it is an engrossing read. This got me reading more background about the papers, the Vietnam war, and the US' China containment policy.

* Much of the US' continued presence in the Middle East is due to this policy.
* I've always wondered why the US maintained such close ties to the Philippines. This explains it, at least in part.
* Most interestingly, much of the basis of the Vietnam War was in the name of this policy.
* Nixon's 1972 China visit marked a priority shift from containing China to containing Russia.
* Much of this comes down to the US' hatred of communism. American interventionism itself can largely be explained by anti-communism. A secondary rationale was the intent to not repeat the mistake of appeasement towards Nazi Germany pre-WWII.
* The [X Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Article) gives some background into the US' ingrown anti-communism.
* One of Obama's big geopolitical moves in 2011 was a pivot of military resources out of the Middle East and into the APAC region.
* On the topic of Obama, the drone strike program was viewed as a black mark on his legacy. However, it's now known that the program was masterminded by the Bush administration, and during transition Bush pushed strongly for Obama to maintain this policy position. Similarly, Trump's trade war with China is seen as a black mark on his (fairly laughable) legacy; I wouldn't be surprised if this general policy position was carried over from the Obama administration.

#### [Abstracting away correctness](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/abstracting-away-correctness)

(New year, new `.md`!)

This is a great post about language API quality. It's quite opinionated, but I thought the arguments were sound. The specific pattern under attack is the multiple-return pattern found in Go (and also commonly encountered in Node's error-first callbacks). I agree with the author's overall point that "misuse-resistant design" is a standard to strive for, and Rust definitely does a great job with this (at the cost of high up-front complexity, notably with the borrow checker). In contrast, the author claims that Go presents an exceedingly simple (and hence attractive) interface to developers; however, this is just a facade, with the true complexity arising as various gotchas.
