#### Tips for big product launches

- Set **dates first** instead of **features first**. With featuers first, all dates end up being padded. Setting dates first forces you to really scope correctly and identify the MVP, and get to a state where you can start iterating. "Plan for 6 weeks and schedule for 3 weeks; plan to miss but aim to succeed."
- For the MVP, plan out acceptance tests, and adhere to them strictly. Use these as accountability tools for an objective measurement of progress. If an acceptance test is not passing by a deadline, really hone in on it.
- Learning how to correctly handle a big launch is hard. "This is why I don't recommend juniors join startups." At larger companies, you can fail without risking the existence of the company, and you can observe good practices. Because there are more large launches, you can evaluate them against each other for quality.

#### [China containment policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_containment_policy)

I never thought history was interesting. In high school, I treated AP US History as simply another bundle of credits to jumpstart college.

The NYT published [How Neil Sheehan Got the Pentagon Papers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/pentagon-papers-neil-sheehan.html) today, and it is an engrossing read. This got me reading more background about the papers, the Vietnam war, and the US' China containment policy.

* Much of the US' continued presence in the Middle East is due to this policy.
* I've always wondered why the US maintained such close ties to the Philippines. This explains it, at least in part.
* Most interestingly, much of the basis of the Vietnam War was in the name of this policy.
* Nixon's 1972 China visit marked a priority shift from containing China to containing Russia.
* Much of this comes down to the US' hatred of communism. American interventionism itself can largely be explained by anti-communism. A secondary rationale was the intent to not repeat the mistake of appeasement towards Nazi Germany pre-WWII.
* The [X Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Article) gives some background into the US' ingrown anti-communism.
* One of Obama's big geopolitical moves in 2011 was a pivot of military resources out of the Middle East and into the APAC region.
* On the topic of Obama, the drone strike program was viewed as a black mark on his legacy. However, it's now known that the program was masterminded by the Bush administration, and during transition Bush pushed strongly for Obama to maintain this policy position. Similarly, Trump's trade war with China is seen as a black mark on his (fairly laughable) legacy; I wouldn't be surprised if this general policy position was carried over from the Obama administration.

#### [HN: Uber discovered theyâ€™d been defrauded out of 2/3 of their ad spend](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25623858)

Good discussion about the "ad-exchange DSP bubble," of which Rocket Fuel (my first company) was a part of. I'm sure glad to be a part of that any more.

#### [Abstracting away correctness](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/abstracting-away-correctness)

(New year, new `.md`!)

This is a great post about language API quality. It's quite opinionated, but I thought the arguments were sound. The specific pattern under attack is the multiple-return pattern found in Go (and also commonly encountered in Node's error-first callbacks). I agree with the author's overall point that "misuse-resistant design" is a standard to strive for, and Rust definitely does a great job with this (at the cost of high up-front complexity, notably with the borrow checker). In contrast, the author claims that Go presents an exceedingly simple (and hence attractive) interface to developers; however, this is just a facade, with the true complexity arising as various gotchas.
