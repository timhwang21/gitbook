# About

I'm a frontend engineer mainly working with Typescript and React. I write some backend code on occasion (Rails and Phoenix), but as of now I'm mostly content with moving divs around. After a short stint as an engineering manager, I'm currently back to being an individual contributor, which is where I feel the most productive and fulfilled.

I currently work at a crypto fintech company called [Nash](https://nash.io/). We launched our decentralized exchange recently (September 2019) -- [check it out!](https://app.nash.io/) (Not available in all locations, unfortunately.)

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about type theory, category theory, and functional programming. While I generally write pseudocode using pen and paper, I try to write in Haskell when I'm attempting to produce something I can actually run. However, lately I've been interested in seeing how far the limits of Typescript's type system can go when it comes to FP. (If you're interested, [check this out](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) -- someone has painstakingly implemented higher kinded types in TS and it's been my latest obsession.)

I wrote my first line of "real" code in October 2015. I attended the San Francisco January 2016 cohort of [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/), and it changed my life. I'd recommend it to anyone.

Prior to software engineering, I was a graduate student studying the psychology of decision making. To this date, dropping out two and a half years in to attend App Academy and pursue software engineering remains one of the best decisions I've ever made.

Outside of coding, my main creative outlet is photography. [You can check out my portfolio here.](https://timhwang21.myportfolio.com/) While I'm mostly satisfied with my pictures, I'm relieved that programming and not photography is my main source of income.
