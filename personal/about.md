# About

I'm a frontend engineer mainly working with Typescript and React. While I intermittently dabble in backend (Rails and Phoenix), as of now I'm mostly content with moving divs around. After a short stint as an engineering manager, I'm currently back to being an individual contributor, which is where I feel the most productive and fulfilled.

I currently work at a crypto fintech company called [Nash](https://nash.io/). We launched our decentralized exchange recently (September 2019) -- [check it out!](https://app.nash.io/) (Not available in all locations, unfortunately.)

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about type theory, category theory, and functional programming. For this, I generally code in either Haskell, Typescript, or good old pen and paper.

I wrote my first line of "real" code in October 2015. I attended the San Francisco January 2016 cohort of [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/), and it changed my life. I'd recommend it to anyone. Previously, I was a graduate student studying the psychology of decision making. To this date, dropping out to pursue software engineering remains one of the best decisions I've ever made.

Outside of coding, my main creative outlet is photography. [You can check out my portfolio here.](https://timhwang21.myportfolio.com/) While I'm mostly satisfied with my pictures, I'm relieved that programming and not photography is my main source of income.
