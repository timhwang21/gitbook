# About

I'm a fullstack engineer mainly working with Typescript, React, and Rails. I currently work at the identity verification startup [Persona Identities](https://withpersona.com/), where we're building the identity layer of the internet. [We recently announced our Series A!](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/persona-raises-17-5m-for-an-identify-verification-platform-the-goes-beyond-user-ids-and-passwords/)

I wrote my first line of "real" code in October 2015. I attended the San Francisco January 2016 cohort of [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/), and it changed my life. I'd recommend it to anyone, and my experiences have sparked a passion for mentoring individuals looking to change careers and break into the tech world.

Previously, I was a graduate student studying the psychology of decision making. To this date, dropping out to pursue software engineering remains one of the best decisions I've ever made.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about type theory, category theory, and functional programming. For this, I generally code in either Haskell, Typescript, or good old pen and paper. Besides coding, my main creative outlet is photography. [You can check out my portfolio here.](https://timhwang21.myportfolio.com/)
