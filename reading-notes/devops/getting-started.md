# Getting started

It might seem intimidating to learn devops on the job, given how mission-critical devops tends to be. Thus, actually developing expertise seems like a bit of a paradox.

In reality, it's totally possible to learn on the job. Start with a basic low-risk system like dev / CI and flesh out functionality. For practice, can start with deploying a stateless web app, then add postgres, then add redis caching, then wrap in Docker, then distribute with k8s, and so on.
