# Help

`:help [search]` searches the Vim docs for the current command. However, search can be refined by prefixing the mode.

* `:help R`: not so useful docs on replace mode
* `:help ^R`: docs for `<Ctrl-r>`
* `:help i_^R`: insert contents of register in context of insert mode
* `:help c_^R`: insert contents of register in context of command mode
