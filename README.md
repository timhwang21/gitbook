# Intro

This is an attempt to better structure what has been a loose collection of notes, bookmarks, and programming tricks. The hope is that this can serve as a resource to quickly share ideas and to organize interesting ideas from others.

This repository generally focuses on active tricks that are expected to be used day-to-day over configuration-based tricks. For a poorly organized list of my configuration-based tricks, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/timhwang21/dotfiles/).
