# Intro

This "blog" is an attempt to better structure what has been a loose collection of notes, bookmarks, and programming tricks.

My primary motivation for setting up this site is to provide a fallback for my terrible memory. Having so many of the interesting ideas I encounter and conversations I have slip out of my leaky brain is incredibly wasteful in terms of both time and energy. However, while the primary purpose of this site is to serve as a more organized categorization of my thoughts, I hope that others can find the tips and tricks here useful, and am always open to suggestions!

In lieu of a traditional chronologically organized structure, this blog is organized as a book, with each page being a "living" micro-blogpost of sorts. I might add or remove things over time based on how appropriate I think certain content is. In general, I'll probably remove content that I realize is more obvious and well-known than I had realized, as there's no point contributing more noise to Google search results when quality resources are already getting harder and harder to find.

Content-wise, I'm mainly focused on documenting "active" tricks that are expected to be used day-to-day (such as a way to quickly batch edit files). This is opposed to tricks based on configuration (such as adding syntax highlighting to a filepicker), which tend to be less flexible and more dependent on ones' individual developer environment. If you're interested in my dev env setup, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/timhwang21/dotfiles/).
