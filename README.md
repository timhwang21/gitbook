# Intro

This "blog" is an attempt to better structure what has been a loose collection of notes, bookmarks, and programming tricks. In lieu of a traditional chronologically organized structure, this blog is organized as a ["digital garden"](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) or ["personal canon"](https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/) wiki.

The primary intended audience is myself. Writing things out forces me to untangle and corral unstructured thoughts and ideas, and forces me to examine them with greater scrutiny, in a structured manner. The fact that the output is easily shareable with peers is a nice bonus.

Pages are meant to be living documents, and will be written as quick references rather than as detailed tutorials. Content-wise, I'm mainly focused on documenting "active" tricks that are expected to be used day-to-day \(such as a way to quickly batch edit files\). This is opposed to tricks based on configuration \(such as adding syntax highlighting to a filepicker\), which tend to be less flexible and more dependent on ones' individual developer environment.

If you're interested in my dev env setup, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/timhwang21/dotfiles/).
