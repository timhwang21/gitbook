# Intro

This "blog" is an attempt to better structure what has been a loose collection of notes, bookmarks, and programming tricks. In lieu of a traditional chronologically organized structure, this blog is organized as a ["digital garden"](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) or ["personal canon"](https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/) wiki.

The primary intended audience is myself. Writing things out forces me to untangle and corral unstructured thoughts and ideas, and forces me to examine them with greater scrutiny, in a structured manner. The fact that the output is easily shareable with peers is a nice bonus.

Pages are meant to be living documents, and will be written as quick references rather than as detailed tutorials. Content-wise, I'm mainly focused on documenting "active" tricks that are expected to be used day-to-day \(such as a way to quickly batch edit files\). This is opposed to tricks based on configuration \(such as adding syntax highlighting to a filepicker\), which tend to be less flexible and more dependent on ones' individual developer environment.

## About

I'm a fullstack engineer mainly working with Typescript, React, and Rails. I currently work at the identity verification startup [Persona Identities](https://withpersona.com/), where we're building the identity layer of the internet. [We're hiring!](https://boards.greenhouse.io/persona)

I wrote my first line of "real" code in October 2015. I attended the San Francisco January 2016 cohort of [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/), and it changed my life. I'd recommend it to anyone, and my experiences have sparked a passion for mentoring individuals looking to change careers and break into the tech world.

Previously, I was a graduate student studying the psychology of decision making. To this date, dropping out to pursue software engineering remains one of the best decisions I've ever made.
